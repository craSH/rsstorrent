About:
   rsstorrent.py is a simple python script to download torrents using rss feeds. When run, it checks whether or not the rss feeds have new torrent items. If there are new items, it downloads the .torrent file ready for your torrent client of choice (rtorrent?) to carry on the download.

Install:

  If you haven't already, install the python feedparser and yaml modules. This can be done on Ubuntu linux with the following command:

   sudo apt-get install python-feedparser python-yaml

On Windows, under Cygwin you need to select the python-feedparser and python-yaml package.

On Mac you need to install mac ports (http://www.macports.org then install py-feedparser and py-yaml with the following command

   sudo port install py-feedparser py-yaml

Finally, you need to create the configuration directory and file. A sample configuration file is provided, place it in ${HOME}/.config/rsstorrent/rsstorrent.yaml

In the rsstorrent.yaml file, modify the download_dir, timestamp, verbose, and feeds settings as you wish.

Run with python ./rsstorrent.py
